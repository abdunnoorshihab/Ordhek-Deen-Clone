          Indeed, all praise belongs to Allah. We seek refuge in Him from the
          evils within ourselves and from our ill deeds. Peace and
          <br />blessings be upon the Prophet (€).

          Marriage is a distinctive blessing given by Almighty Allah and a
          vital Sunnah of the Prophet (). According to the Qur'an and Hadith,
          wedding is<br />
          regarded as a means of purity, half of the deen (religion) and a
          means of financial prosperity. Allah commands the believers to marry
          for its benefits<br />
          morally, spiritually, socially and psychologically. The Holy
          Prophet() said, "Marriage is my<br />
          precept and my practice. Those who do not follow my practice are not
          of me."<br />
          And<br />
          "When a man has married, he has completed one half of his religion."
          The purpose of marriage is to provide a legal union which safeguards
          society<br />
          from moral and social degradation. On the other hand, it is a matter
          of great regret that people being influenced by western civilization
          are chasing<br />
          the sick race of so-called equality between men and women that goes
          against the commandment of Allah and consequently, moral degradation
          is<br />
          taking place in the society. Indeed, the main reason for the
          infiltration of the uncivilized culture of the West in education,
          work, and marriage is not to<br />
          follow the rules based on Islamic Shariah and the lack of complete
          religious education. As a result, marriage has become challenging
          and the<br />
          society is being burdened constantly with various degradations
          including adultery, fornication, extra marital affairs, rape,
          suicide etc.

          Moreover, those who are struggling against the un-Islamic culture of
          the family and the so-called social norms to cling to the Sunnah in
          this age of<br />
          dreadful fitna (a state of trouble or chaos) are facing many
          complications to find pious life partners. Pondering over the issues
          we, some sinful<br />
          slaves of Allah became optimistic to solve these problems and
          finally succeeded in establishing a Bangladeshi Islamic matrimonial
          platform,<br />
          OrdhekDeen.com and on January 1, 2021, we launched its journey
          effectively. By the mercy and special blessings of Allah, hundreds
          of practicing<br />
          Muslims have already been married through the website,
          Alhamdulillah.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our aim is to make this website a Shariah based Islamic matrimony
          platform and to make it easy to find religious matchmakers. Our
          prime motto of<br />
          the Site is to popularize the Sunnah way of Islamic marriage by
          wiping out all superstitions and barbarism of the present jahiliyya
          (days of ignorance)<br />
          society and making everyone aware against dowry (an eternal curse
          for the bride's family) and encouraging the matchmaking with mahr<br />
          (valuable gift by grooms).
        </p>
        <p>
          To conclude, we have far-reaching plans for the development of our
          website and we are constantly researching to make the Site easier to
          the users.<br />
          We are trying our level best to deliver this service efficiently to
          all Muslim brothers and sisters as soon as possible. May Allah keep
          our intentions<br />
          pure, make all our good deeds easy and grant us blessings. Ameen.
